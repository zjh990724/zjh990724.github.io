Welcome to my personal homepage! I am Zhang Jianghong, a Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. My academic journey is rooted in the pursuit of innovative solutions for sustainable energy and material development, with a focus on high-entropy materials and multiscale simulations.

Throughout my academic and research career, I have cultivated expertise in the development and optimization of electrocatalysts for water-splitting applications. My work is fueled by a curiosity to bridge fundamental science and practical applications in material innovation.

Beyond research, I have had the privilege of contributing to academia as an invited journal reviewer and mentor, and I take pride in fostering a safe and collaborative laboratory environment. I am also a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Gold Medal at the Chinese College Studentsâ€™ "Internet Plus" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition.

Feel free to explore my projects, publications, and interests. Let's connect and collaborate to make a difference in materials science and engineering!
