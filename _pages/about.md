    Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have been recognized as emerged electrocatalysts that facilitate the high efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction   (OER). With the noble metals free, they are cost-effective and a potential candidate to replace the traditional RuO<sub>2</sub> and IrO<sub>2</sub>. The catalysis can be further improved through the construction of their lattice structures. This study proposes an innovative approach which makes use of pulsed laser irradiation to synthesize nano-sized amorphous MPEA particles. The low-boiling-point element Mg is incorporated with Fe, Co and Ni to synthesize MPEAs (FeCoNi)<sub>1-x</sub>Mg<sub>x</sub> (x=0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35). The high thermal temperature generated during the interaction between the laser beam and MPEAs gives rise to the evaporation of Mg leading to the amorphization. The increase of Mg content intensifies the amorphization extent. (FeCoNi)<sub>0.65</sub>Mg<sub>0.35</sub> achieves a lower overpotential (256 mV@10 mA/m<sup>2</sup>) for OER compared to the crystal counterparts and demonstrates long-term catalytic stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that amorphization strengthens OOH* adsorption energy due to improved charge transfer. This research provides insights into novel synthesis strategies and the catalytic mechanisms of amorphous alloys.

    Recently, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been widely applied in sterilization due to their excellent antibacterial properties. However, AgNPs require rigorous storage conditions because their antibacterial performances are significantly affected by environmental conditions. Instant fabrication provides a remedy for this drawback. In this study, we propose a self-powered electrodeposition system to synthesize sub-10-nm AgNPs, consisting of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as the self-powered source, a capacitor for storing electrical energy from the TENG, and an electrochemical component for electrodeposition. The self-powered system with larger capacitance and discharging voltage tends to deliver smaller AgNPs due to the nucleation mechanism dominated by current density. Furthermore, antibacterial tests reveal that compared to direct current (DC) electrodeposition, the TENG-based electrodeposition can synthesize finer-sized AgNPs (<10 nm) with overwhelming antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (with 100% efficiency at 2 h). This work provides a new strategy for the self-powered, instant, and controllable electrodeposition of nanoparticles.
