Welcome to my personal homepage! I am Zhang Jianghong, a Ph.D. candidate in Materials Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. My academic journey is rooted in the pursuit of innovative solutions for sustainable energy and material development, with a focus on high-entropy materials and multiscale simulations.

Throughout my academic and research career, I have cultivated expertise in the development and optimization of electrocatalysts for water-splitting applications. My work is fueled by a curiosity to bridge fundamental science and practical applications in material innovation.

Beyond research, I have had the privilege of contributing to academia as an invited journal reviewer and mentor, and I take pride in fostering a safe and collaborative laboratory environment. I am also a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Gold Medal at the Chinese College Studentsâ€™ "Internet Plus" Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition.

Feel free to explore my projects, publications, and interests. Let's connect and collaborate to make a difference in materials science and engineering!

    Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have been recognized as emerged electrocatalysts that facilitate the high efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction   (OER). With the noble metals free, they are cost-effective and a potential candidate to replace the traditional RuO2 and IrO2.   The catalysis can be further improved through the construction of their lattice structures. This study proposes an innovative approach which makes use of pulsed laser irradiation to synthesize nano-sized amorphous MPEA particles. The low-boiling-point element Mg is incorporated with Fe, Co and Ni to synthesize MPEAs (FeCoNi)1-xMgx (x=0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35). The high thermal temperature generated during the interaction between the laser beam and MPEAs gives rise to the evaporation of Mg leading to the amorphization. The increase of Mg content intensifies the amorphization extent. (FeCoNi)0.65Mg0.35 achieves a lower overpotential (256 mV@10 mA/cm2) for OER compared to the crystal counterparts and demonstrates long-term catalytic stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that amorphization strengthens OOH* adsorption energy due to improved charge transfer. This research provides insights into novel synthesis strategies and the catalytic mechanisms of amorphous alloys.
